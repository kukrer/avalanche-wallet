            The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Dispute
            Resolution section. All Disputes will be arbitrated before a single arbitrator
            experienced in the software industry who is jointly selected and mutually approved by
            you and us or, if you and we are unable to or fail to agree on the selection of the
            arbitrator within 15 days of the demand for arbitration being served, who is appointed
            by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS) in accordance with its rules. The
            arbitration will be administered by JAMS pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration
            Rules and Procedures (and in accordance with the expedited procedures in those rules)
            (the “JAMS Rules”), except as modified by this Dispute Resolution section. In the event
            of a conflict between the JAMS Rules and this Dispute Resolution section, this Dispute
            Resolution section shall control, subject to countervailing law, unless the parties
            agree otherwise. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of
            the “Limitations of Liability” section below as to the types and amounts of damages for
            which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive
            relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
            warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to
            initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at

            If we elect arbitration, we shall pay all JAMS filing costs and administrative fees

            fees (other than hearing fees) shall be paid in accordance with the JAMS Rules, or in
            accordance with countervailing law if contrary to the JAMS Rules. Each party shall bear
            the expense of its own attorneys' fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a

            You and the Company agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between
            the parties individually. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, (A) NO ARBITRATION SHALL
            BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER PROCEEDING; (B) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE
            TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; AND (C)
            THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED
            REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY OTHER PERSONS. Unless
            consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, an award in arbitration shall
            determine the rights and obligations of such parties only, and only with respect to the
            claims in arbitration, and shall not (a) determine the rights, obligations, or interests
            of anyone other than all parties to the arbitration, or resolve any Dispute of anyone
            other than any such party; nor (b) make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone
            other than any such party. No administrator arbitrator shall have the power or authority
            to waive, modify, or fail to enforce this specific paragraph, and any attempt to do so,
            whether by rule, policy, arbitration decision or otherwise, shall be invalid and
            unenforceable. If this specific paragraph (“No Class Actions”) is held unenforceable in
            its entirety, then the entire Dispute Resolution section will be deemed void.

            Your seed phrase is the master key that allows you to access your digital asset. If you

            fluctuations or loss of value. You should not transact in digital assets unless you
            fully understand the nature of the transaction you are entering into and the extent of
            your exposure to loss.
